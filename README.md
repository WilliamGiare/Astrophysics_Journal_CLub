A Data Analysis of the Sapienza Astrophysics Journal Club Meetings, Academic year 2020/2021.

## Meetings
The meetings were typically made of two talks of 30 minutes each with Academics (≥ postdocs) usually being the first speakers and students (≤ PhD students) the second speakers. Anyway, sometimes both the speakers were students or Academics as well as there were meetings with only one talk (held either by Academics or Students).
- Total Number of **Meetings**: 16
- Total Number of **Meetings with two Speakers**: 11
- Total Number of **Meetings with one Speaker**: 5

### Audience
In the figure below we show the number of people joining each meeting, the audience fluctuations within the same meeting (error bars) and the cumulative average number of people in the audience (green line) with its standard deviation (light green region). The blue (red) dots represent the meetings with two (one) speakers.
- **Cumulative average number of people in the audience**: 15.5 ± 3.0
- Average audience of **meetings with two speakers**: 16.0 ± 2.4
- Average audience of **meetings with one speaker**: 14.6 ± 3.7
- No significative differences are observed in the audience between first and second talks
