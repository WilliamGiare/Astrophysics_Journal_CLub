>> Overview of the Acadeimc Year 2020-2021 

In this Repository you can find an Analysis of the data collected during the Sapienza Astrophysics Journal Club Meetings, Academic year 2020/2021.

## Meetings
The meetings are typically made of two talks of 30 minuts each with Academics (≥ postdocotral researchers) usually being the first speakers and students (≤ PhD students) the second speakers. Anyway sometimes both the speakers were students or Academics as well as some meetings consit of only one talk (hold eihter by Academics or Students).
- Total Number of **Meetings**: 15
- Total Number of **Metings with two Speakers**: 10
- Total Number of **Meetings with one Speaker**: 5

### Audience

In the fiugure below we show the number of people joining each meeting (black dots), the audience fluctuations within the same meeting (error bars) and the cumulative average number of people in the adience (green line) togheter with its standard deviation (light green region). 

- **Cumulative averege number of peeople in the audience**: 15.4 ± 3.0
-  No significative differences are observed in the audience between first and second talks
